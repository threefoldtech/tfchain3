# Specifications of tfchain 3

## Introduction

With tfchain we created a blockchain that serves as the backbone of our Threefold grid. This blockchain is a registar for nodes, farms, twins and deployment contract.
Tfchain currently has implemented a proof of authority network, where only authorized nodes can join the network. There are no staking rewards and no traditional inflation, 
making it so that there is no incentive for outsiders to run a tfchain node. 

## Tfchain 3 will serve as the backbone of first regional internet

The idea is that for a regional internet, a tfchain will be created and will run in that context. 

### Native token

The native token on tfchain3 will be called "CHI" (Chi (also spelled qi) refers to the vital life force or energy that runs through all living beings.

### Staking

Nominated proof of stake with traditional inflation will be used to incentive the community running validators.

inflation curve with be implemented as: TODO

Additionally 5% of the revenue generated by deployments on tfchain3 will be sent to the validators.

### Farming

Nodes connected to tfchain3 will receive rewards in CHI. Additional rewards for utilization will be handed out to Farmers when their nodes are being used.

#### Boosters in line with utilization

### Assets

We should be able to create tokens using Multisig.

### Treasury

A Treasury should be in place that can spend CHI using Multisig transactions.
